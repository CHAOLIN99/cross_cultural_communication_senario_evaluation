Explanation: This scenario reflects different attitudes towards hierarchy and authority. The male from Mexico is comfortable questioning or reviewing the work of human resources, which suggests a lower acceptance of hierarchy.

Despite this, the primary cultural dimension at play is **Power Distance**, which refers to the extent to which less powerful members of a society accept and expect power to be distributed unequally.",power distance
